Bird Game

Team Members: Matt Vermont, Chris Braun, Ryan Trackenberg, Wyatt Achey, Trevor Seidelt

Description: Our game consits of 3 mini games, each focusing on 1 aspect of the specific bird chosen (Migration, Food, and Reproduction). Each of the mini games resembles 
a popular game from the past that many kids enjoyed, being Frogger, The Claw, and Flappy Bird. After each game, there will be a quiz question that will allow the player
to earn more points to get a higher point total and land on the high score board. The high scores will encourage kids to play again and again to get a higher score.
